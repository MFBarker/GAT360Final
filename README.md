Hello! 
GAT360Final, game titled Head Out, is a Finals Project at Neumont College of Computer Science. In 2 weeks we have to design a game to demonstrate all of the qualities we learned in GAT360.
Heads Out is a short puzzle game where you have to bring along your key to escaping, in a box, except you have to put the box down in order to free up hand space for puzzles!

This game features:
2-handed inventory management
Classic 3D puzzle systems
Beautifully crafted rooms to explore

This project was created in Unreal Engine with the use of 'Brutalist Architecture Office', 'Interaction System',
and 'The Immersive Template' found on the Epic Store!

Team Members include Joseph Perez(Gtagudy) as full-stack developer!

To launch the game, download the zip file off of the Joseph Perez branch and unzip it in a safe place! Then boot up Unreal Engine version 5.6 and open the project/file at the location where you unzipped it!
Then you can go ahead and hit the play button at the top! Hope you enjoy!
